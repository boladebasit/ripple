# **Ripple: Decentralized Water Cooperation Protocol**

A blockchain-based governance and incentive system for fair, transparent, and cooperative water resource management across regions and stakeholders.

---

## **Overview**

Ripple enables decentralized cooperation over shared water resources using smart contracts. It supports fair allocation, usage tracking, dispute resolution, conservation incentives, and more—especially for regions sharing rivers, lakes, or groundwater basins.

The system includes seven core smart contracts:

1. **Water Rights Registry** – Tracks ownership, allocation, and usage entitlements
2. **Usage Reporting Contract** – Collects, verifies, and logs water usage data
3. **Incentive Rewards Contract** – Distributes token-based rewards for sustainable usage
4. **Governance DAO Contract** – Facilitates voting and policy proposals by stakeholders
5. **Dispute Arbitration Contract** – Manages claims and disputes over misuse or overuse
6. **Infrastructure Funding Contract** – Coordinates investment into shared water infrastructure
7. **Data Oracle Integration Contract** – Links with IoT oracles to verify real-world water flow and consumption

## **Features**

- Transparent water allocation and usage tracking  
- Decentralized governance for cross-border cooperation  
- Smart dispute resolution mechanisms  
- Sustainability incentives with token rewards  
- Funding model for shared water infrastructure  
- Integration with off-chain water data via oracles  
- Modular, interoperable contract structure

## **Smart Contracts**

### **Water Rights Registry**

- Registers and maintains water access rights per stakeholder  
- Supports transfers and leasing of rights  
- Immutable historical logs  
- Integrates with governance policies

### **Usage Reporting Contract**

- Logs periodic usage by stakeholder  
- Accepts verified reports from IoT sensors or inspectors  
- Enforces reporting intervals and validation criteria  
- Flags anomalies and potential overuse

### **Incentive Rewards Contract**

- Issues token rewards for sustainable usage or conservation  
- Supports staking for low-usage bonuses  
- Aligns rewards with governance-approved sustainability targets

### **Governance DAO Contract**

- Enables decentralized voting on water policies  
- Weighted voting based on stake or rights allocation  
- Proposes updates to allocations, incentives, or policies  
- Manages proposal lifecycle and quorum rules

### **Dispute Arbitration Contract**

- Accepts claims about overuse, contamination, or access violations  
- Facilitates resolution through voting, escrow, or mediator selection  
- Escalation mechanisms for unresolved claims

### **Infrastructure Funding Contract**

- Accepts pooled funding from stakeholders for shared projects  
- Manages voting and disbursement of funds  
- Tracks milestones and results through smart contract state

### **Data Oracle Integration Contract**

- Interfaces with trusted off-chain data sources  
- Ingests sensor data: flow rate, reservoir levels, quality metrics  
- Triggers contract logic based on verified measurements  
- Supports multiple oracle networks (e.g., Chainlink, Redstone)

## **Installation**

1. Install Clarinet CLI  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Run tests:  
   ```bash  
   npm test  
  ```
4. Deploy contracts:
    ```bash
    clarinet deploy  
    ```

## **Usage**

Each smart contract is modular and can be deployed independently depending on the cooperation scenario (e.g., river-sharing between nations or regions). Detailed contract documentation is available in the /contracts directory.

## **Testing**

Ripple smart contracts include full test coverage using Vitest. Run all tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
